## Games Included

### Uncatch
A fast-paced cursor survival game.  
You play inside a circle, collecting white points while being chased by a rainbow-colored ball. If it catches your cursor, you lose.

### Ping Pong AI
A super tough but beatable ping pong game.  
You're "Youser", and you're up against a bot that adapts to your moves. Do you have what it takes?
